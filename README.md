##SCSS
[SCSS / SASS (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets)](http://sass-lang.com) Sass is an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic language.
It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax.

Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized, and get small stylesheets up and running quickly, particularly with the help of the Compass style library.

Using SASS can make CSS file more easy to maintain. 

### Compass
[Compass](http://compass-style.org) is the SASS compailer to compile SASS / SCSS files into regular CSS files.

#### Mac users
For Mac users, all you need is to insall Compass gem by using following command:

```
$ gem install compass
```

To start compass, go to the project root folder and use:

```
$ compass watch
```
This command will start monitoring `SASS` folder and compile css files then place to `stylesheets` folder

#### Windows users:
For Windows users, you can either install [Ruby for Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org) then install compass gem as Mac user.
Or install a paid ($10) app: [Compass App](http://compass.kkbox.com)
